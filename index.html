			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>
				I like dancing, singing and doing sport. In the past, I have sung in choirs, individually in performances and taken lessons for over 10 years. I also enjoy dancing, and I have practiced all kinds of dances: classical, modern, jazz. I have done so many extra activities in my life that I can't remember everyone. Today, I am praticing fitness with my mum, an activity that brings us closer together.

			<h2>Passions</h2>
			<p>
				As written before, I didn't find my real passion, as I have done many different activities that I stopped. But I can say that I really love to spend time with my family or friends, doing shopping, watching movies and going to cinema (especially if Pierre Niney is playing).

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>
				Concerning my project, I am looking for an internship in the commercial domain. I already have a contact in a firm that sells SAGE programs (accounting systems for the business management). It could be very interesting but I hesitate with doing an internship more about fashion and things like that.
